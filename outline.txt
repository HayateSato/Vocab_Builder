NOT YET ------------------------------------------------------------------
- Would you like to add pronunciation audio to the flashcards?
- Should I generate a Dockerfile to make the app easily deployable?
- Should I add search functionality to look up flashcards?
- Would you like to download the flashcards as a CSV file?
- the improvement of translation (the translation is sometimes off - it replaces with the first meaning if the text has several meanings)
- can I add catgegory/tag to my flashcard ( all verbs | verbs used with a preposition etc. )
- when its a noun, it should add the artikle (der, die, das)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE
- Do you want to save flashcards to a database?
- Do you want to display all saved flashcards on the app?
- does it work with a sentence? change it to a sentence, and let users choose as which word they want to add to their flashcard
when there are several meanings available, it should show several options
- eliminate the dots or unwanted non-alphanumeircal letter


DONE but needs improvement
- does it work for a handwritten words?  -> the accuracy is not hight but it works
